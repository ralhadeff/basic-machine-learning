# Reinforcement Learning

_work in progress_

I will implement several approaches for RL, gradually increasing in complexicity on the classic _snake_ game.

* `manual_policy` - the state space and the actions are the same as in all other implementations, but the policy mapping state -> action is manually written as a dictionary (so no learning is performed). This example can be viewed as a reference for expected results with learning.
* `policy_iteration` -
