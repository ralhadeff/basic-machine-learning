# Artificial neural network

Work in progress

This folder contains the neural network module (`neural_network.py`) which enables the building and stacking of neuron layers (`class Layer`) and a module to constuct-, train-, and predict with-ANNs (`network.ipynb`).  

The network can do binary or multiclass classifications, and regression. There are three Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` files for regression and classifications examples.  

Lastly, the regression example also contains an exploratory analysis of how exactly the network achieves its goal by looking manually at all the weights and trying to make sense of it (with several simplifications).
