# Artificial neural network

Work in progress

In this folder there is the neural network module (`neural_network.py`) which enables the building and stacking of neuron layers (`class Layer`) and another module to constuct, train, and predict with, ANNs (`network.py`).  

The network can do binary classification and regression. There are two Jupyter notebook files for examples of regression and classification.  

Lastly, the regression example also contains an exploratory analysis of how exactly the network achieves its goal by looking manually at all the weights and trying to make sense of it (with several simplifications).
