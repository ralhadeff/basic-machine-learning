| Term  | Brief description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adversarial learning | A technique used, mostly for malicious motivations, to fool machine learning tools (*e.g.* using special character to fool simple spam classifiers | [rifle-turtle](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16597276/google-ai-image-attacks-adversarial-turtle-rifle-3d-printed) |
| Document clustering | Clustering textual documents together in a way that makes sense to humans, *e.g.* by subject or type of document | - |
| Gradient boosting | A machine learning technique where different estimators are joined together (typically in sequence) to improve the overall predictions | - |
| Sentiment analysis | A method to decipher subjective human emotion from given data; typically to determine the sentiment (*e.g.* like/dislike) from a text | - |
| Survival analysis | A tool used to investigate the time it takes for an event of interest to occur (*e.g.* death of an organism)  | - |
| Word vector | A numerical representation (in the form of a vector) for words, where each dimension implies a specific feature of the word. Simplified example: king could be [1,1,0] where the first element stands for royalty and the second element stands for maleness (the third is femaleness), now man would be [0,1,0] and female would be [0,0,1], thus, kind-man+female=[1,0,1] which should also correspond to queen | [link](https://medium.com/@jayeshbahire/introduction-to-word-vectors-ea1d4e4b84bf) |
| Container technology | An application bundled together with all its dependencies, libraries, binaries, and configuration files needed to run it - to avoid problems when migrating between different computers (or similar) | - |
