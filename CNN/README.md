# Convolutional neural network

Layers that are typical to CNNs. More complex applications of convolutions were done using Keras or other off-the-shelf libraries for speed (_e.g._ `VariationalAE`). See also `misc` for specific architectures (_e.g._ semantic segmentation).  

`blocks.py` contains several CNN architecture blocks implemented with keras and demonstrated on MNIST in `_blocks_example.ipynb`.
