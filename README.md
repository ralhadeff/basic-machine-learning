This is a simple implementation for basic machine learning tools using Python

This repository will include all my machine learning implementations in python. The purpose of this implementation is for my own training, and it by no means claims to be particularly useful or efficient.

Note: although many sections in the code could be improved for efficiency (e.g. more vectorization) one goal here was to make the code more instructive for a human reading it.
