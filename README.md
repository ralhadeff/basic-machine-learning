This is an implementation for machine learning tools using Python

Written by Raphael Alhadeff, started Jan 2019

This repository will include all my machine learning implementations in python. The purpose of this implementation is for my own training, and it is not particularly efficient.

Note: although many sections in the code could be improved for efficiency (e.g. more vectorization) one of my goals here was to make the code more instructive for a human reading it.
